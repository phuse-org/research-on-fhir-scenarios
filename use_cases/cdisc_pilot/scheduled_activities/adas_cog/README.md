# ADAS-Cog use case

## Description
The H2Q-MC-LZZT(c) study was used as a CDISC Pilot using real data, anonymised.  We suggest this presents a useful 'digital twin' opportunity insofar as we can read from the XPT files containing the standardised SDTM data for the actual assessment s 

## Setup
1. Study Design
    1. The Study Design has a scheduled ADAS-Cog assessment at Screening/Baseline and at Visits 3, 8, 10, and 12, ADAS-Cog, CIBIC+, and DAD will be administered (as an efficacy measure).  Note, this is not a PRO measure
    2. The Measure has the following set of props required to perform the test:
        1. Toys which are replicas of the objects to be named.
        2. Sets of index cards for the word recall, delayed word recall and word recognition items. For each administration of the ADAS there is a designated set of cards specific for that visit and the words are different for each visit.
        3. Scaled drawings of the forms that the patients will copy.
        4. Sets of mazes for the maze solution task.
        5. Sets of numbers and letters for the attention/visual search task.
    3. The results are recorded and a score is calculated  (test results and scores are recorded in the CRF)
2. The Planned events:
    1. In order to properly contextualise the result we also capture the date of the visit in a form
    2. The date of ADAS-Cog will also be captured on the form
